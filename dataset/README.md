# `amazon-sagemaker-in-practice`

## Dataset

We use the [Criteo Labs](http://labs.criteo.com/) dataset, used for the old [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge) for the same purpose.

All files are available in the `amazon-sagemaker-in-practice-workshop` *S3* bucket available in the account you would be given during workshop. If you would like to download dataset on your own, please go [here](http://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset/).
